Docker has revolutionized how we deploy applications. However, building production-ready containers requires following certain best practices to ensure security, performance, and maintainability.

## Use Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds help create smaller, more secure images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:20-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Don't Run as Root

Always run your application as a non-root user:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim
RUN groupadd -r appgroup && useradd -r -g appgroup appuser
WORKDIR /app
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .
USER appuser
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Use Specific Base Image Tags

Avoid using `latest` tags in production:

```dockerfile
# Bad
FROM node:latest

# Good
FROM node:20.11.0-slim
```

## Optimize Layer Caching

Order your Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Dependencies change less frequently
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Source code changes more frequently
COPY . .

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Use .dockerignore

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

```
node_modules
.git
.env
*.md
tests/
```

## Health Checks

Add health checks to your containers:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build Docker images that are secure, efficient, and ready for production deployment.
