Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed how we build applications that understand and generate human language. This guide will help you get started with integrating LLMs into your projects.

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models are neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data. They can understand context, generate human-like text, and perform various language tasks like translation, summarization, and code generation.

## Key Concepts

### Tokens

LLMs process text as tokens, which are chunks of text (roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words):

```python
# Example: "Hello, world!" breaks into tokens
tokens = ["Hello", ",", " world", "!"]
```

### Temperature

Temperature controls randomness in outputs:
- **Low (0.1-0.3)**: More focused, deterministic
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced creativity
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: More creative, varied

### Context Window

The maximum amount of text an LLM can process at once, typically measured in tokens (e.g., 4K, 8K, 128K tokens).

## Basic Integration

Here's how to integrate with an LLM API:

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Prompt Engineering

Effective prompts lead to better results:

```python
# Bad prompt
prompt = "Write code"

# Good prompt
prompt = """Write a Python function that:
- Takes a list of numbers as input
- Returns the sum of all even numbers
- Include type hints and docstring
- Handle empty lists gracefully
"""
```

## Streaming Responses

For better UX, stream responses in real-time:

```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## Conclusion

LLMs are powerful tools that can enhance your applications with natural language capabilities. Start with simple integrations and gradually explore more advanced features like function calling and embeddings.
